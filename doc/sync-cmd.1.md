NOTES
=====

The sync-cmd functions by communicating with various system daemons using DBus over Argo. All DBus messages entering
the control domain come through the rpc-proxy firewall. The rpc-proxy firewall provides a means to filter messages
based on source, destination, interface and member being invoked. A portion of sync-cmd functionality requires additional
rpc-proxy firewall rules beyond those included in a vanilla build of OpenXT.
